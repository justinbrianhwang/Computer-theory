# Computer Theory

A repository for organizing and sharing key theoretical concepts and principles in computer science.

## Concepts

- **Data Structures and Algorithms**
  - Fundamental data structures (arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs) and algorithms (sorting, searching, dynamic programming, graph algorithms).

- **Artificial Intelligence**
  - Concepts related to AI including machine learning algorithms, neural networks, and natural language processing.

- **Operating Systems**
  - Principles and design of operating systems including process management, memory management, file systems, and concurrency.

- **Computer Architecture**
  - Structure and behavior of the computer system including CPU architecture, memory hierarchy, and input/output mechanisms.

- **Software Engineering**
  - Processes and methodologies including project planning and management, requirements analysis, design principles, coding practices, testing, and maintenance.
